# Distribued Neural Network on Edge Devices

## Progressive retraining

1. Download the caltech101 or imagenet dataset.

2. preprocess01.py and preprocess02.py are designed to preprocess the dataset, use ```python3 preprocess01.py``` to generate *label.txt* and use ```python3 preprocess02.py``` to generate *dataset-train.txt* and *dataset-test.txt*.

3. To run the code, type the following command

```
python3 main.py
```
To see the definitions of all the parameters, type the following command:

```python3 main.py --help```
